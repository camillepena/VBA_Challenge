# VBA_Challenge

## Overview and Purpose

In this project, we are going to write code and then refactor that code to provide Steve with the neccessary data to help him inform his parents of the best stock available to them.  We will restructure our code to handle the current amount of stocks in our dataset, and if needed many more.  By refactoring, we will be making the code more effiecient.

## Results


### 2017

2017 was a good year for stock performance for most of the 12 stocks we analyzed.  Only one of the stocks had a negative return.  The trading volume was high as well for most of the stocks.

Execution time was decreased with the refactored code.  Also interestingly, The time needed to run the code decreases every time I run it again.

## Summary

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring

The main advantage of refactoring is it cleans up the code and more efficient.  This can improve the funcationality of the code and allows others to mofre easily read the code.  It can also help with finding bugs and fixing those.  The main disadvantage of refactoring that I encountered was the time to do it.  I would believe the process for much longer would be very difficult.

### Pros and Cons of Refactored Script

The greatest positive of the orginal code was that it was much easier to write, but the refactored code performed much better.  Once I was able to understand the refactored code those it was much easier to read and follow the logic of it.
